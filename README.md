# Newsela

A Python API for loading the Newsela corpus, 
which consists of news articles written for children at various grade levels.
It is loaded in "age-order"; for example, articles written for lower grades are loaded first.

This repository does not contain any language data, which is proprietary. 
The data is loaded from a password-protected drive, and only users with access can load the data.

## Compatibility
